///@brief Mesh input/output suitable for pushing directly into graphics
///libraries.
///
///The core (non-optional) parts of MeshGL are the triVerts indices buffer and
///the vertProperties interleaved vertex buffer, which follow the conventions of
///OpenGL (and other graphic libraries') buffers and are therefore generally
///easy to map directly to other applications' data structures.
///
///The triVerts vector has a stride of 3 and specifies triangles as
///vertex indices. For triVerts = [2, 4, 5, 3, 1, 6, ...], the triangles are [2,
///4, 5], [3, 1, 6], etc. and likewise the halfedges are [2, 4], [4, 5], [5, 2],
///[3, 1], [1, 6], [6, 3], etc.
///
///The triVerts indices should form a manifold mesh: each of the 3 halfedges of
///each triangle should have exactly one paired halfedge in the list, defined as
///having the first index of one equal to the second index of the other and
///vice-versa. However, this is not always possible - consider e.g. a cube with
///normal-vector properties. Shared vertices would turn the cube into a ball by
///interpolating normals - the common solution is to duplicate each corner
///vertex into 3, each with the same position, but different normals
///corresponding to each face. This is exactly what should be done in MeshGL,
///however we request two additional vectors in this case: mergeFromVert and
///mergeToVert. Each vertex mergeFromVert[i] is merged into vertex
///mergeToVert[i], avoiding unreliable floating-point comparisons to recover the
///manifold topology. These merges are simply a union, so which is from and to
///doesn't matter.
///
///If you don't have merge vectors, you can create them with the Merge() method,
///however this will fail if the mesh is not already manifold within the set
///tolerance. For maximum reliability, always store the merge vectors with the
///mesh, e.g. using the EXT_mesh_manifold extension in glTF.
///
///You can have any number of arbitrary floating-point properties per vertex,
///and they will all be interpolated as necessary during operations. It is up to
///you to keep track of which channel represents what type of data. A few of
///Manifold's methods allow you to specify the channel where normals data
///starts, in order to update it automatically for transforms and such. This
///will be easier if your meshes all use the same channels for properties, but
///this is not a requirement. Operations between meshes with different numbers
///of peroperties will simply use the larger numProp and pad the smaller one
///with zeroes.
///
///On output, the triangles are sorted into runs (runIndex, runOriginalID,
///runTransform) that correspond to different mesh inputs. Other 3D libraries
///may refer to these runs as primitives of a mesh (as in glTF) or draw calls,
///as they often represent different materials on different parts of the mesh.
///It is generally a good idea to maintain a map of OriginalIDs to materials to
///make it easy to reapply them after a set of Boolean operations. These runs
///can also be used as input, and thus also ensure a lossless roundtrip of data
///through MeshGL.
///
///As an example, with runIndex = [0, 6, 18, 21] and runOriginalID = [1, 3, 3],
///there are 7 triangles, where the first two are from the input mesh with ID 1,
///the next 4 are from an input mesh with ID 3, and the last triangle is from a
///different copy (instance) of the input mesh with ID 3. These two instances
///can be distinguished by their different runTransform matrices.
///
///You can reconstruct polygonal faces by assembling all the triangles that are
///from the same run and share the same faceID. These faces will be planar
///within the output tolerance.
///
///The halfedgeTangent vector is used to specify the weighted tangent vectors of
///each halfedge for the purpose of using the Refine methods to create a
///smoothly-interpolated surface. They can also be output when calculated
///automatically by the Smooth functions.
///
///MeshGL is an alias for the standard single-precision version. Use MeshGL64 to
///output the full double precision that Manifold uses internally.
